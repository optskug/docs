[*Toyota's Sword in Rock situation*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865370/The_one_who_pulls_out_the_sword_will_be_crowned_king/) (that has been pulled out [quite a bit by Willem and Greg](https://icanhack.nl/blog/secoc-key-extraction/)!)

## Background

tl;dr: Toyota started to use cryptographical signatures to block openpilot (and other hacks). Some smart people in the industry hacked the signatures for _some_ cars, but not all cars.

openpilot, in order to control the steering or latitude, needs to be able to man-in-the-middle the steering control messages used by the lane keep assist system. It blocks the original steering control messages and replaces them with its own. This is done by the forward-facing camera, which is also known as the "Forward Recognition Camera" or "Object Recognition Camera" in Toyota vehicles. The camera is responsible for the lane keep assist in Toyota vehicles.

There is a `STEERING_LKA`-ish message and more in some new Toyotas that currently has an "authentication code" scheme appended to the end. The algorithm and security system for this "authentication code" is somewhat known for certain vehicles but requires a key that is unique to each vehicle to be extracted or smuggled out of the vehicle (https://icanhack.nl/blog/secoc-key-extraction/). Not all vehicles are able to have their keys extracted with what is currently known. Without the key or knowledge of the system, third parties like comma and users cannot control the vehicle. While vehicles that have had their keys smuggled out are currently working with openpilot.

## Cars

### 🟢 Successfully running openpilot

These cars can run openpilot but are not listed on https://comma.ai/vehicles or [CARS.md](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md) because comma.ai (the company) understandably doesn't want to own the security key hacking process. Follow the [Setup Guide](#setup-guide) below and you'll have it working.

* 2021-2023 RAV4 Prime
  * Upstreamed into openpilot's master branch.
* 2021-2023 Sienna Hybrid
  * Upstreamed into openpilot's master branch.
  * Early 2024 might work too? Few data points.
    https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/905950538816978974/1350659380592513142
* 2020-2022 Yaris Hybrid (EUDM/JDM/MXDM)
  * Memory dump hack works but the key is not in the same address as RAV4 Prime.
  * Brute force efforts to find key location successful on both European and Japanese Yaris Hybrid. European user eventually gave up full installation due to unrelated C3 malfunction.
  * openpilot working with heavy hacked out [branch](https://github.com/nelsonjchen/openpilot/commits/yaris-gon/)
  * First Continental Radar + Camera setup going and thus first radar controlled ACC vehicle done with. This does not mean longitudinal is controlled by openpilot though.
  * Not sold in the USA, but is in Australia, Japan, and Europe
  * Only one guy using it in Japan, unfortunately. Help double the population!

#### Notes

* These vehicles have TSS 2.0.
* These vehicles do not use the HSM.
* These all seem to share the commonality of a ~~version 1 bootloader~~[^4] ? on the EPS
* Longitudinal
  * Some people seem to have it going. It is a [work in progress in getting it upstreamed to comma's codebase](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/pull/1385).
  * Resume command spams still works from existing implementation so stop and go without touching is active if openpilot is active.

### 🟡 May be possible to hack but hasn't been tried

If you have one of these cars, please stop by the [comma Discord](https://discord.comma.ai)'s #toyota-security channel - we need more information from people like you.

* 2023 US-made Corolla (VIN starts with `5`)
  * Uses TSS 3.0 but does not appear to have ECU Security Key or SecOC steps when replacing the forward camera. It's unknown whether it has TSK, and if yes in what form. Maybe they just don't do the pairing thing but hardcode a key. No one knows. This is still of great interest to the Toyota Security Key / SecOC efforts as it may provide better insight into the TSS 3.0 system without the key complication.
  * Note that this is not the same as the 2023 TMC/JP-made Corolla or the 2024+ Corolla. It happens to be applicable to a single year of US-made Corolla.
* 2021+ Yaris Cross Hybrid (EUDM/JDM/MXDM)
  * Brute force script may work.
* 2021+ GR Yaris (EUDM/JDM/MXDM)
  * TSS 2.0
  * Brute force script may work.
  * Seems externally similar to Yaris Hybrid?
  * Would be the first manual transmission.

# Setup Guide

* [Key Extraction](#key-extraction) if you don't know the key.
* [Key Installation](#key-installation) if you know the key.

## Key Extraction

Your car has a security key that Toyota doesn't want you to have. \
Follow this guide to run a [hardware exploit](https://icanhack.nl/blog/secoc-key-extraction/) to extract the key.

### Step 1. Install `TSK Manager`

At home, turn on C3X with your phone charger. Ignore the low voltage warning.

Choose `Custom Software` and enter the URL `tsk.lvin.ca`

![](img/v3.install.jpg)

![](img/v3.tsk-manager.home.jpg)

Unplug the power to turn off the device.

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. A normal phone or laptop charger works fine. If not, USB A-to-C cables work well, and USB PD (Power Delivery) sometimes doesn't work.
2. The installation takes about 2 minutes, or ~20 minutes if an OS update is needed. OS update downloads a ton of stuff so don't be too far away from the router.
3. If your internet is slow, the installation could get stuck at 98% and then on the comma logo. The installation is still continuing on the background so give it up to 10 additional minutes before giving up and trying again.
4. In some cases the installation gets stuck in "registering device" screen. If this happens, unplug the device to power off, plug it back in, and then tap-tap-tap on the screen as it boots to reset the device. Afterward, install `tsk.lvin.ca`
</details>

### Step 2. Install the hardware

Go to your car and connect everything including Comma Power (OBD2 connector + long cable).

Official Setup Guide: https://comma.ai/setup/comma-3x

Turn the car on and off - C3X should remain powered on.

![](img/v3.tsk-manager.incar.jpg)

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. The car harness sends a 12V signal instead of the usual 5V. Do not plug in anything other than C3X.
2. For connecting C3X to the harness, always use the right-angled OBD-C cable that came with the C3X. comma.ai sells it if you need more: https://comma.ai/shop/obd-c-cable. If you must buy your own, USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 is required.
3. You can remove Comma Power later but connect it for now.
</details>

### Step 3. Put the car into `Not Ready To Drive` mode

Slowly press the `POWER` button twice WITHOUT pressing the brake pedal.

![](img/v2.nrtd1.jpg) ![](img/v2.nrtd2.jpg)

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. Some cars refer to `Not Ready To Drive` mode as `IGNITION ON` mode while others refer to it as `POWER ON` mode. Regardless of what your car calls it, get on the mode that says `Not Ready To Drive`.
2. The first press turns on `ACCESSORY` mode. The second press activates `Not Ready To Drive` mode.
3. Some cars don't have `ACCESSORY` mode. Doesn't matter - get on the mode that says `Not Ready To Drive`.
</details>

### Step 4. Run the exploit using `TSK Manager`

Run `TSK Extractor`. The car may beep and flash LKAS & Power Steering errors.

![](img/v3.ext-success.jpg)

Congratulations, you have the key now!

> [!WARNING]
> It's theoretically possible for someone to remotely hack your car with the key under very specific circumstances. You don't need to protect the key like it's your bank password, but still don't post it on Discord.

Sometimes `TSK Extractor` can't talk to the car. Try again.

![](img/v3.ext-known.jpg)

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. Relax. The exploit is safe to run and can't break your car even if you yank the cable.
2. Once extracted, the key is installed in `/cache/params/SecOCKey` and `/data/params/d/SecOCKey` files.
3. In rare cases, `TSK Extractor` may hit an unexpected error.  
![](img/v3.ext-unknown.jpg)  
  The exploit is proven to work but `TSK Extractor` GUI is new. Send @calvinspark a photo and then try again.
4. Normally the extraction succeeds on the first try or after the first car restart. If you tried the extractor 3 times for 3 car restarts (=9 times) and still doesn't work, there might be a hardware problem and/or you're doing something wrong. Stop and talk to us in #toyota-security.
</details>

### Step 5. Install `commaai/nightly-dev`

Start your car's engine.

Go to the `Reboot Menu` and `Install commaai/nigtly-dev`.

`commaai/nightly-dev` is the only branch from comma.ai with TSK support.

![](img/v3.reboot.jpg)

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. `commaai/nightly-dev` is the newest and possibly unstable branch from comma.ai with TSK support.
2. Frustratingly, there isn't a release branch from comma.ai with TSK support.
3. Openpilot won't be able to drive your car if you install a branch without TSK support. See [Forks](#forks) for more information.
</details>

### Step 6. Calibrate & Clean up

C3X should show to the 15mph calibration screen.

![](img/v3.calibrate.jpg)

If you're able to calibrate and use openpilot to use the steering wheel (aka "lat support"), you can clean up the cables and put the covers back on.

You're done! Congratulations!

* `commaai/nightly-dev` can't use the gas and brake pedals (aka "long support") on TSK vehicles. Monitor this PR (https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/pull/1385) for long support progress. Experimental mode is also not supported because experimental mode requires long support.


* Comma Power (OBD2 connector + long cable) is optional. It's not necessary for using C3X, but keeping it allows C3X to stay powered on when you turn off the car, which allows you to upload logs and SSH in more easily. [If you do this, you'll be in the training set and your specific driving will improve faster than others.](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/954493346250887168/1328801037578145802)

<details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

1. If you get an `LKAS` error, either the key was not installed or you're running a fork/branch without TSK support.
2. If C3x says `Car unrecognized` or `Dashcam mode for unsupported car`, you need to do [Fingerprinting](https://github.com/optskug/docs/blob/19c61098eac496ded2fb1cacb732be6671c38c69/README.md#step-5-fingerprinting-if-the-car-is-not-recognized). However, this shouldn't happen anymore. If it does, please talk to us in #toyota-security.
3. The key will change if you get a new bumper because the bumper has distance sensors that use the security key. Instead of applying the existing key to the bumper, they replace the key on all parts of the car. The same goes for many other parts with SecOC components. Even if you never get into an accident, the key can still change if a Toyota service technician presses a wrong button.
</details>

## Key Installation

### You shouldn't need to do this

Modern openpilot and its forks have an [auto-key-install process](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/34401/files) that runs on every car start.

This means that **uninstalling openpilot or resetting comma no longer uninstalls the security key.**

**🎉🎉🎉 Gone are the days of key installation. From now on, just install openpilot and go drive, just like non-TSK users! 🎉🎉🎉**

### When to do this

You may need to still reinstall the key if
1. your C3 died and you got a new C3X,
2. the key was never installed in `/cache/params/SecOCKey` because you did it the old SSH way and never ran `TSK Manager` / `TSK Keyboard`,
3. the installed key in `/cache/params/SecOCKey` was deleted, or
4. you're using an old fork without the auto-key-installer.

Follow this guide to reinstall the key.

### Method 1. Use the built-in `TSK Manager`/`TSK Keyboard`

Some forks/branches have `TSK Manager` or `TSK Keyboard` under Settings.

⚙ > `Device` > `TSK Manager`/`TSK Keyboard`

![](img/v2.settings-keyboard.jpg)

If it's there, use it to type in your key and install, and then reboot.

### Method 2. SSH and install the key to `/cache/params/SecOCKey` and `/data/params/d/SecOCKey` files

Redo [Step 4B-4. Install the security key & Reboot](https://github.com/optskug/docs/blob/19c61098eac496ded2fb1cacb732be6671c38c69/README.md#step-4b-4-install-the-security-key--reboot).

### Method 3. Uninstall openpilot, install the key using `TSK Manager`, and install openpilot

Follow [Step 1. Install TSK Manager](#step-1-install-tsk-manager) to install `TSK Manager` via the URL `tsk.lvin.ca`

No need to go to the car. Run `TSK Keyboard`. Use it to type in your key and install.

![](img/v3.tsk-keyboard.jpg)

## Advanced Topic: Run the exploit using SSH manually

This is how to [extract the key manually](https://github.com/optskug/docs/blob/19c61098eac496ded2fb1cacb732be6671c38c69/README.md#step-4b-run-the-exploit-using-ssh-manually). Most people can skip this.

## Forks

Forks may offer additional functionality or changes that comma openpilot may not offer or are unwilling to offer.

You can totally have a good time with comma openpilot without using a fork too. You can also have a better time or a worst time with forks!

### Which Fork Should I Use?

> [!CAUTION]
> Using forks present a real danger so do your research and understand what fork you are installing and what it does. Do not go down this path without research!
>
> Some forks will brick your C3X. \
> Some forks may not be made for the current C3X. \
> comma may make changes to newly produced C3Xs that necessitate always running the newest comma openpilot and forks might brick them.
>
> Some forks contain banned code. \
> Using it will get you banned from using any comma.ai cloud resource or debugging. \
> They will not restore access.
>
> Some forks have nudgeless-lane-change. \
> Simply clicking the turn signal will move your car to the next lane. \
> Without any checks. \
> Yes, it will drive into the car next to you.
>
> Some forks play a blood-curdling goat scream at max volume randomly. 🐐
>
> comma will not answer to support you if you're running forks until you restore back to comma openpilot.

Begin your research in [comma.ai Discord's #custom-forks](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/538741329799413760). Please do not ask about forks outside of that channel.

For all forks, you should read their README documentation as well.

If you're new, please start with comma openpilot with `commaai/nightly-dev` and use it for two weeks. This is the same as the latest official version with only lateral support (with TSK support enabled). This will give you a good baseline to compare the other forks to and sort out any issues with the underlying hardware. Additionally, comma will only do/take bug or hardware support with comma openpilot which is critical for this period. The [bathtub curve of hardware reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve) is very real.

Then familiarize yourself with the communities through Discord for each fork you are looking to install. While the comma Discord may not offer any support for forks, their communities may or may not for their fork's issues. Do not skip getting familiar with comma openpilot as you should have a basic understanding first.

If you acknowledge the warning above and are still looking to try a fork that supports SecOC/TSK, the following are available to install at your own risk. Keep in mind that this page is community maintained and may not stay up to date so please send in changes/fixes, or notices of any inaccuracies:

## Bounty Statuses

### 🗳️ comma.ai Vote for Toyota Security

In June 2022, comma.ai created a paid vote/crowdfund for making openpilot support Toyota Security. Once they get 500 votes at $100 a vote, they have 6 months to figure it out and open source a solution; Otherwise, a refund will happen and all the money is returned. The current status of that was: [![Latest Comma Vote Count for Toyota Security ($100 ea.)](https://shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcellshield.info%2Fgs%3FspreadSheetId%3D1GOeN2ph9JLvOlwStZso988YPT-lILl7yZqFW8UPCFZM%26cellRange%3DB1&label=Latest%20Comma%20Vote%20Count%20for%20Toyota%20Security%20(%24100%20ea.))](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOeN2ph9JLvOlwStZso988YPT-lILl7yZqFW8UPCFZM/edit#gid=0&range=B1)[^2] .

Vote counts were reported every week or similar and are recorded in this spreadsheet by the community:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOeN2ph9JLvOlwStZso988YPT-lILl7yZqFW8UPCFZM/edit#gid=0

The result of this vote, even though it has not met its target cost, is [a pull request was produced for the RAV4 Prime to be supported in openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/31179). It was eventually merged in.

In January, the vote page was taken down. Below is a snapshot.

# Current History

Here's a brief to get anybody going into this ECU Security Key issue up to speed. I'll keep updating this with links to the relevant Discord messages and other stuff as I find them.

Discord links may be linking to the middle of the conversation. Scroll up and down for context.

Many of these Discord links are to a pre-hidden channel named `#toyota-security` in the  comma.ai Discord. Accessing `#toyota-security` on comma.ai Discord requires completing the simple prompt in `#join-development`. Otherwise, it is inaccessible. More often than not, the Discord links are to `#toyota-security` in the comma.ai Discord, so please complete the prompt.

Most if not all Discord links are to the comma.ai Discord accessible with an invite from https://discord.comma.ai unless otherwise noted. These other Discords include:

* Retropilot (RP): https://discord.gg/GzWegVa.
* Sunnypilot's Openpilot Server (SP): https://discord.gg/TCTvFTKrAV.
* Openpilot Enthusiasts (Formerly "Openpilot community") (OPC): https://discord.gg/rRB7eDKccy
* MoreTorque (MT): https://discord.gg/439DM9KJ4r
* Frogpilot (FP): https://github.com/FrogAi/FrogPilot?tab=readme-ov-file#discord

The activities, actions, and discussions on non-comma.ai Discords are/may not supported by or affiliated with comma.ai (this may even apply even to the comma.ai Discord too). In the case of MoreTorque, comma.ai is strongly opposed to that community/Discord. That said, the ECU Security Key issues affects all and relevant events and information may be there as well.


## Background

For Toyota openpilot enthusiasts, the community was very excited for the RAV4 Prime, a high performance Toyota that was going to have "Toyota Safety Sense 2" (TSS2), other awesome Toyota traits such as reliability, utility, and economy, and, new for a Toyota SUV, speed. It is the fastest accelerating real Toyota excluding Lexuses as the Supra, a BMW badged as a Toyota, does not count.

Previously seen TSS2 vehicles have had an architecture where both latitude and longitudinal are both controlled by the front-facing camera. openpilot was able to intercept and control latitude and longitudinal all at the front-facing camera of TSS2 vehicles, promising full openpilot capabilities. No other taps in the CAN of the vehicle were needed to control or block messages for this capability.

The typical process for adding a new TSS2 vehicle is simply creating a fingerprint with reference to the closest similar vehicle and trying it out.

## Timeline

### 2013

* [IOActive experiments with injecting packets to steer a Prius in a widely disseminated and seminal security assessment. Their research around this time also led to them being able to **remotely** inject through the radio with a FCA vehicle and cause it to steer. In an unwise move, they demonstrated this in the middle of a busy highway. Anyways, not great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX0rRRUdOKU)
  * This is way in the past, but it's important to note that even large slow dinosaurs or turtles _move_ and it's been a few years.

### August 2020

matty#8553 came on Discord as the first user with a RAV4 Prime and a new Comma 2. crazysim#7797 / @nelsonjchen offered to get the RAV4 Prime supported. [Some worrying observations were immediately made in a GitHub issue after validating that the hardware was sound and working on another non-Prime TSS2 RAV4 ](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/2103):

* The `STEERING_LKA` CAN message is now 8 bytes in size. Existing TSS2 vehicles had a 5 byte `STEERING_LKA` CAN message.
  * There is a 4 byte authentication code on the CAN message instead of the simple 1 byte checksum of past Toyotas.
* [@nelsonjchen implemented and tried many checksum algorithms to try and create an identical `STEERING_LKA` message to what was seen in Cabana](https://github.com/nelsonjchen/toyota_checksum_2020_scratch/blob/8422bd3b4b7770391e940d31202b8129fdebcb02/src/lib.rs#L97-L108). None of them worked.
* @nelsonjchen asked around on many Discords and other well-known users for help. No one was able to help.
* @nelsonjchen notices that the "checksum" is the not the same for messages with the same data. It doesn't seem like a checksum. Maybe some other state is kept somewhere?
* The authentication code messages change between ignitions.
* The messages are different between vehicles.
* The same inputs result in different "checksum"/authentication code outputs.
* [@nelsonjchen notices that Toyota filed a patent about message authentication on the CAN bus.](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/524327905937850394/749576060110241824)

  * [At the Comma Team Group Chat, Erich, a prominent Toyota community contributor and community Discord moderator, asked about ECU Security Key:](https://youtu.be/qTaPD0l_8PM?t=23390)
    * Adeeb: I think we'll just look into it a bit and just kind of understand what the scope of the issue was and we just decided this isn't affecting too many cars yet that's not where we're choosing. We've aggressively chosen in the last year or so to not spend time on specific cars

       We've spent almost all of our time doing things that improve everybody's experience with openpilot.
       Now the comma three's out, maybe we can get back to doing stuff that helps some subset of the users but we've we've really been pushing on the experience that every user sees

       Hotz: I'm counting on the community for that one of you out there we put five thousand dollars of commas hard-earned money up.

    [23:49.760 --> 23:52.360]  \[Audience Question\] Which car brands are the easiest to support
    [23:52.360 --> 23:53.360]  and the hardest to support?
    [23:53.360 --> 23:55.600]  \<cut\>
    [23:55.600 --> 23:56.760]  \<cut\>
    [23:59.760 --> 24:03.360]  Adeeb: So easiest to support, this is really changing now, actually.
    [24:03.360 --> 24:06.360]  The software platforms and the cars, at least for the ADAS,
    [24:06.360 --> 24:09.360]  were pretty stable for about like three, four years.
    [24:09.360 --> 24:10.760]  And we did a lot of this initial work
    [24:10.760 --> 24:12.360]  maybe three, four years ago.
    [24:12.360 --> 24:13.760]  And now we're in this cycle where
    [24:13.760 --> 24:15.360]  Honda, Toyota, Honda, Toyota, Honda,
    [24:15.360 --> 24:18.160]  we're in this cycle where Honda, Toyota, Honda, a lot of them
    [24:18.160 --> 24:21.080]  are changing their platforms right at the same time.
    [24:21.080 --> 24:23.720]  So that's the hard part right now,
    [24:23.720 --> 24:25.600]  is we're getting this influx that
    [24:25.600 --> 24:27.960]  are all different right now.
    [24:27.960 --> 24:31.400]  The hardest ones now are the ones that implement the Autosar
    [24:31.400 --> 24:33.160]  secure onboard communication.
    [24:33.160 --> 24:34.560]  We haven't spent much time on it,
    [24:34.560 --> 24:36.320]  but that'll be a little bit of a project.
    [24:36.320 --> 24:39.600]  It just adds more overhead to porting a car.

### March 2024

* [Major Update from former comma staffer Willem Melching]():
  * > New blog post is out! Extracting the SecOC keys used for securing the CAN Bus on the 2021+ RAV4 Prime. https://icanhack.nl/blog/secoc-key-extraction/
    >
    > Research started all the way in 2022, but took many evenings of reverse engineering to get code execution.
    >
    > PoC: https://github.com/I-CAN-hack/secoc
  * > * Extracted the firmware from an ECU, using Fault Injection to bypass the locked debug port.
    > * Reverse engineered the application code, to understand how SecOC was
        implemented and find the location of the keys in RAM.
    > * Reverse engineered the bootloader, to understand how the update procedure  works and how we can upload and run shellcode.
    > * We built a shellcode that extracts the keys from RAM and sends them out over CAN, then reboots the device.
  * It is a long read, but it is exactly why this is such a hard problem and there are some serious hurdles to overcome when it comes to extracting the keys.
  * An incomplete exerpts of some other information:
    * There is a way to extract the SecOC key from the RAV4 Prime without disassembly.
    * During the construction of the payload, a secret key must have been extracted from the firmware in order to upload code to the EPS, run it, and extract the key. This isn't correct secure design but it lets third parties like comma.ai and I-CAN-hack to extract the key by uploading temporary code to the EPS to extract the key.
    * By not using the "Hardware Security Module" in the firmware, the key can be extracted from memory. Newer cars may use the HSM, which hides the key from memory, and getting the key out from those is an unsolved problem. *What* are the newer cars is unclear, but the 2023 Corolla Cross they looked at was using the HSM.
  * Some people are looking to get the key from their Rav4 Prime

* comma Discord Sept 25 Developer Meeting notes
  * Jason Young (jyoung8607), a prominent non-comma.ai openpilot contributor and VW openpilot saint, is wanting to work on moving forward Willem's RAV4 Prime work to be rebased atop current comma openpilot with Willem's guidance (pd0wm) while he is visiting comma.ai's office in San Diego on vacation.
  * Approved goal by Adeeb is to have release comma openpilot be able to work with the RAV4 Prime *if* the key is provided by the user.
  * SecOC Key extraction is outside of the scope of this work though and will not be included. In other words, plug-and-play is not to be expected. The are open to seeing if/any UI or workflow might come from the community on this.
* Jason opens a new draft pull request superceding Willem's pull request: https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/33654
* Produced a user group list of working vehicles and users on Jason's request: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sprUteWtCVH6nQ6JfsmX0liIJ58H4nAVWxtAdorfW4c/edit?gid=0#gid=0
* [A mainland China/PRC user with a PRC-built 2022 Sienna comes into the Frogpilot Discord. They are able to extract the key but for whatever reason, can't write "Params".

  * Note: They are also using a Mr. One C3 clone since comma doesn't appear to ship to China from their POV for whatever reason. This complicates debugging and upstreaming to comma's branch is impossible for their vehicle.

  * "Ready for testers! I have a test branch for you (not the one in the PR) that forces the fingerprint to RAV4 Prime. This means it should work even if you have a Sienna, or a RAV4 Prime with a different fingerprint."

  * Effort is spent to try to preserve and archive share-and-enjoy's very special and self-hacked copy as the git commit reported up to comma does not appear to have prerequsite or necessary changes.

    * "The only thing I can think of, it's possible you were extremely lucky with `openpilotLongitudinalControl` and managed to filter the old message which still has [Stop and Go] relevant control bits, and transparent passthrough the new SecOC message with the actual acceleration command."
    * ["LOL that's exactly what you managed to do" "You accidentally made partial long control work "](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/905950538816978974/1291459549794140182)

    * "Just FYI, yes incode was running the same SnG hack as me from tranlocquy. tranlocquy told me how to do it, and actually did it for incode."
    * **"Now, it does NOT stop at red lights or stop signs, but DOES auto-resume from stop with a lead car."**
* [(Longitudinal Support) Jason posts a PR to document the ACC command to the opendbc repo for SecOC/TSK vehicles. "Toyota: DBC message for SecOC longitudinal control #1337"](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/pull/1337)

  1. It won't be in dashcam mode, if there's a correctly saved SecOC key, it'll just work
  2. It will require a non-release branch, just like alpha openpilot longitudinal
  3. It won't appear in comma.ai/vehicles or CARS.md
  4. comma will not ship the key retrieval mechanism, you're on your own for that

  >  Ok so I changed the ACC_CONTROL_2’s ACCEL_CMD to match the ACC_CONTROL’s scaling in the dbc. I just manually edited it for now rather than figuring out how the generation works. I can throw my changes up to my fork tonight.
  >
  >  The good news is it worked 🎉🎉🎉! OP was clearly controlling long. It just doesn’t seem to be fully working. It seemed something was not quite right but I don’t have any experience with OP long so let me know if it is expected when on city streets. Acceleration seemed to not always work, even with no lead car, my rav would not always accelerate up to my set point. Many times I would have to accelerate manually up to the desired speed but then OP would be good about decelerating down for lead cars and stopping at stop lights.
  >
  >  I also noticed at clear and green light stop lights and when cars were a whole block in front of me OP would decelerate.
  >
  >  If I came to a complete stop I always had to hit the gas to get going again. Also rolling up to a red light there was some creep where the car would not come to a complete stop until many times I was in the cross walk.
  >
  >You can see some of these issues in the attached videos.

The payloads Willem provided work for code execution, but the brute force script was not able to find a key in the RAM dump. They are hoping that by reverse engineering the full firmware we may gain a better understanding of how/where the key is stored.

  We also determined that the pinout for the Toyota B harness is incorrect for our cars. The CAN busses are flipped so the relay ends up on bus 1 instead of bus 0/2. Once the busses are flipped we are able to see the different ECUs and interact with the EPS ECU. I have a feeling the same may be true for all of the TSS3.0 vehicles."

  * The NNLC stuff works for the RAV4 Prime EPS where available. It is similar to the 2020-2021 RAV4 except for the whole security key thing.

[^1]: This is an image of the CAN BUS traffic on a RAV4 Prime. The "checksum" for the Lane Keep Assist messages are now very high in entropy, indicative of some sort of signing or encryption being used.

[^2]: As a shameless plug, do you like those real-time updating embedded values from the Google Spreadsheet up there for the bounty and vote tracker? I made [cellshield.info](https://cellshield.info) for that and other non-security key related uses. Check it out and let me know outside of this discussion if you have any comments!

[^3]: Speculated from TechInfo lookup. TechInfo lookup is looking at Toyota's Techinfo site (payment required, minimum ~$25) and seeing if replacing the "Object recognition camera" / "Forward recognition camera" requires an ECU Security Key update. https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/524327905937850394/894262224552624228

[^4]: gregjhogan stated that the first byte of a UDS firmware version is not a bootloader version. https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/905950538816978974/1273746993394487376
    > The first byte returned when reading the firmware versions using UDS read data by id isn't part of the version number, it is how many applications are running on the ECU (for example if it has two cores, there may be a separate application running on each core) and it tells you how many you can extract from the rest of the data returned.
